Personal Statement / Interests 
I am a 25-year-old mature student currently attending Canterbury Christ Church University (CCCU) to study software engineering. I have a passion for technology and am always looking to further my knowledge within this field. The programming languages such as C# and python are what I am currently practicing and learning at university. I am effective within a team but can be equally effective working alone, ensuring that all targets are met and completed in a timely organised manner. I enjoy setting new goals and targets both in and out of the workplace so that I can develop myself and expand my knowledge. In my free time I enjoy exploring the outdoors or relaxing with family, exercising via gym and am currently a member of the CCCU running club. Furthermore, I enjoy learning new skills by enrolling on online courses, listening to books on audible and playing video games.

Information: 
I was a liquids manufacturer at Coty based in Ashford, Kent and my job role included being responsible for managing the machines I worked on as well as the recording of information collected while running said machines. This data recorded comprised of temperatures, speeds, pressure in the vessels, dates and times which were put onto the system along with the materials and chemicals used. This needed to be correct and accurate so that the machines ran safely, and no faulty products were made. As well as keeping the machines running in a timely manner and collecting data on them, I had to make sure I was following the correct protocols, wearing the correct PPE. The way I ensured the processes ran smoothly was by always making sure I follow the documents I printed before starting every shift, making sure that they are kept in the correct folder for other staff to view. Lastly, I made sure I printed the correct labels and filled out the spread sheets to a high standard of accuracy.
